# basic-ml-notebooks
Some jupyter notebooks for basic ML tasks.

`basic-feedforward.ipynb` is the most basic example of a feedforward neural net I could create.

`basic-cnn.ipynb` is a basic CNN on MNIST. This is from the Udacity foundations of deep learning course that I no longer have access to. 

`using-tfrecords.ipynb` is example code for using tensorflow's TFRecords.

`mnist-lstm.ipynb` is a simple example of using LSTMs on the MNIST dataset.
